# Documix App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
Documix is a command-line tool that requires no traditional sign-up or login process. When a new user first hears about Documix, they typically install it using a package manager like pip and then run it directly from their terminal. There is no need to create an account because the tool is designed to be universally accessible via the command line. Users quickly get started by consulting simple documentation that explains how to input the required URL and other optional flags. Since there are no passwords or personal profiles to manage, the onboarding process is straightforward and focused solely on installation and setup of command-line parameters.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once Documix is installed, the main point of interaction is the terminal itself, which serves as the dashboard for the tool. The default view is the command-line interface where users are prompted to enter commands such as 'documix package <url>' along with optional settings like output format and ignore patterns. Instead of a graphical menu, users work with straightforward text prompts and real-time console outputs that indicate progress and status. This main interface guides the user through the flow by displaying clear messages and updates, ensuring that they know when the scraping process begins, how many pages are being processed, and when the final packaged file is ready.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a user enters a command to package a site’s documentation, Documix begins by validating the provided URL and any associated flags. At this initial stage, the tool checks for valid input and sets up the environment based on user preferences, such as specifying the output file name, choosing to include metadata, or setting the scraper order. After the inputs are processed, the tool transitions into the scraping phase. This stage is driven by a command-line output that logs the progress of fetching pages from the website. Documix interacts with the designated scraping tool—by default Firecrawl—but also supports alternatives like Scrapy or wget if required. During the scraping process, the tool concurrently retrieves several pages, applies ignore rules as set via a .docignore file or CLI flags, and checks for any blocked pages. If any pages are skipped because of robots.txt restrictions or authentication issues, the tool notifies the user with a warning message, yet also offers an override option if the situation permits.

After successfully collecting the data, the tool transitions into the packaging phase. In this step, Documix aggregates the content of each page into a single file that follows a Repomix-inspired structure. The file begins with a header showing the website name, generation date, and the total count of pages processed. Each page’s content is appended under its own section, which may optionally include metadata such as the page title and last modified date if the user has opted for this detail. The aggregation process concludes with the creation of the final output file, which is then saved based on preset naming conventions or according to user-defined customization, such as incorporating timestamps or specific prefixes and suffixes.

## Settings and Account Management
Although Documix does not include traditional account management features, it offers a high level of configuration through command-line flags and external configuration files. Users can manage settings related to ignore patterns, output file formats, naming conventions, and even the order in which scrapers are applied. These settings can be specified on a per-command basis or saved in a permanent configuration file for repeat use. Additionally, options like verbose mode for detailed logging help users troubleshoot and adjust their preferences in real time. Once a command is executed, users return to the terminal prompt where they can either run another command using their saved settings or modify their configuration to better tailor the tool to their needs.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Documix is designed to handle errors gracefully and inform users of any issues encountered during its operation. If an invalid URL is entered or the site is not reachable, the tool immediately responds with an error message that explains the problem. When encountering pages that are blocked by robots.txt or trigger authentication challenges, Documix issues clear warnings and provides users with an option to override these restrictions if it is appropriate to do so. In addition, network errors or other unexpected interruptions trigger specific, verbose log messages that help the user diagnose the source of the problem. These error states ensure that even if the tool deviates from its expected path, users receive comprehensive feedback and guidance on how to reinitiate or adjust their command inputs.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The journey with Documix starts with a simple installation and immediate access through the command line. From the moment a user types in the initial command, Documix carries them through a well-documented process beginning with URL validation and customizable configuration setups. The tool then swiftly moves into a concurrent scraping operation that respects user-specified ignore patterns and manages errors via informative messages. Once data collection is complete, all content is aggregated into a single, structured file that is ready for further processing by AI models. With every step clearly logged and feedback provided in real time, users are empowered to efficiently transform entire documentation sites into neatly packaged files. This end-to-end process fulfills the goal of making documentation scraping and packaging both powerful and accessible for developers, researchers, and technical writers alike.
