# Backend Structure Document for Documix

This document details the backend architecture, hosting solutions, and infrastructure components for Documix. This tool scrapes website documentation and packages it into a structured text file for ingestion by large language models. The following sections provide an overview of the project’s backend design, using everyday language to explain the setup.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend of Documix is built as a command-line tool running on Python (version 3.8 and above). Although it is not a traditional web server, it has a clear internal structure to manage scraping, packaging, and logging functions. Here’s how it is organized:

- **Layered Design:**
  - **Scraping Layer:** Orchestrates the scraping process using Firecrawl as the primary scraper, along with alternatives like Scrapy and wget as backups.
  - **Packaging Layer:** Aggregates and formats scraped data into a single text or Markdown file, following a structure inspired by Repomix.
  - **Configuration & CLI Interface:** Allows users to set parameters via command-line flags (for example, output file names, ignore patterns, and scraper selection).
  - **Error Handling & Logging:** Implements verbose logging modes and detailed error messages to help with troubleshooting.

- **Scalability and Maintainability:** 
  - The use of dynamic configuration for scraper selection and a plugin-like system for future scrapers ensures that new tools can be easily integrated.
  - The modular design makes it straightforward to maintain and update individual components without disrupting the entire flow.

- **Performance:** 
  - The backend supports concurrent/multi-threaded scraping to handle multiple pages at once, reducing processing times for larger websites.

## 2. Database Management

Since Documix is primarily designed to process data on the fly and generate output files, it does not rely on a heavy, centralized database. However, small-scale data management practices are used:

- **File-Based Storage:**
  - Scraped content is directly aggregated into output files (.txt or .md), eliminating the need for a persistent, large-scale database.

- **Optional Caching with Lightweight Databases:**
  - For users who wish to cache interim scraping results or log session data, a lightweight database like SQLite could be optionally used. This would hold temporary data without complex configurations.

## 3. Database Schema

If the optional SQLite database is used for caching or logging purposes, the schema can be understood as follows:

- **Human Readable Format:**
  - A table for storing session logs might include fields such as:
    - Session ID (unique identifier for each run)
    - Start Time and End Time
    - Total Pages Processed
    - Number of Pages Skipped or Blocked
    - Error Messages (if any)

- **Example SQL Schema:**

  If using an SQL-based system like SQLite, an example schema might be:

  • Table: sessions
    - id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
    - start_time: TEXT (stores the time the session started)
    - end_time: TEXT (stores the time the session ended)
    - total_pages: INTEGER (total number of pages attempted)
    - pages_skipped: INTEGER (count of pages skipped due to ignore rules or robots.txt)
    - errors: TEXT (logs any error messages encountered)

This schema helps in understanding and debugging the tool’s performance during scraping sessions without requiring a complex setup.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

While Documix is primarily a command-line tool, future iterations could expose an API for integration with other systems. Currently, the communication between different components is handled internally, but here’s an outline of potential RESTful API structure if needed:

- **Endpoint Overview:**
  - **POST /scrape:** Initiates a scraping session by providing a URL and optional parameters (such as ignore patterns or chosen scraper).
  - **GET /status/{session_id}:** Retrieves the status of a current or past scraping session, including progress and any logged errors.
  - **GET /output/{session_id}:** Returns a link or the content of the packaged file produced by the session.

These endpoints would allow external orchestration of scraping tasks, making Documix more flexible for larger integrations or web-based control panels.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

Documix is distributed as a Python package available on PyPI and is executed locally by users. Here’s how hosting and distribution are addressed:

- **Local Execution:**
  - The primary hosting is on the user’s machine, meaning all processing happens locally, which simplifies scalability as each execution is independent.

- **Cloud Integration (Optional):**
  - For enterprise users or future integrations, a backend server could be hosted on cloud providers like AWS or GCP, allowing remote triggering of scraping sessions via the API. This setup would provide high availability and manage resources on-demand.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Reliability:** Processing is done locally, reducing dependency on external servers. 
  - **Scalability:** Cloud hosting options allow scaling for large or repeated scraping tasks if needed in future versions.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Minimal resources are used for local execution; cloud deployment would be on an as-needed basis.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

The infrastructure for Documix is designed to ensure that the application performs well and remains responsive. Key components include:

- **Local System Resources:**
  - Utilizes the computing power of the host machine for running multi-threaded processes and handling concurrent scraping tasks.

- **Optional Load Balancing:**
  - In potential future scenarios where a cloud-based API is deployed, load balancers can distribute tasks across multiple instances to handle heavy loads.

- **Caching Mechanisms:**
  - Simple in-memory caches or file-based temporary storage may be used to store intermediate scraping results. This enhances performance by avoiding redundant network calls.

- **Content Delivery Options:**
  - When packaged content is delivered, it can be stored in cloud storage solutions (such as AWS S3) and served via Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) if the project’s scale increases.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a key consideration, even for a tool that runs primarily on the command line. Documix implements the following measures:

- **Input Validation:**
  - All URLs and parameters provided are validated to prevent malicious exploitation.

- **Respect for Robots.txt:**
  - The tool automatically adheres to the robots.txt rules of websites, ensuring compliance with site policies. A warning system is in place and users are notified if any pages are blocked.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error handling and detailed logging prevent data leakage and help track unusual activities.

- **Local Execution:**
  - Since data is processed and stored locally (unless cloud integration is opt-in), user data remains on their machine without unnecessary exposure over the internet.

- **Future Integrations:**
  - If a cloud-based API is implemented later, standard security practices such as HTTPS, authentication tokens, and encrypted data storage will be adopted.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Continuous monitoring and maintenance are essential to ensure Documix performs reliably:

- **Logging:**
  - A verbose mode provides detailed logs of every session, including start and end times, pages processed, and any errors encountered.

- **Error Reporting:**
  - The tool issues clear error messages, enabling quick resolution of network issues or unexpected website structures.

- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - Regular updates to the tool’s libraries and dependencies (e.g., scrapers and HTTP clients) keep it compatible with changing web standards.
  - The codebase is modular, making it easier to update specific components without affecting the entire system.

- **Optional Monitoring Tools:**
  - For cloud deployments, standard monitoring tools (CloudWatch, Prometheus, etc.) can be employed to track performance and resource utilization.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

Documix’s backend structure is built around a modular, command-line architecture optimized for scraping and packaging website documentation. Key points include:

- **Scalable and Maintainable Design:** Dynamic scraper selection and modular components make it both adaptable and robust.

- **Efficient Data Processing:** Direct file output ensures minimal overhead, with optional lightweight database usage for logging and caching.

- **Flexible Integration Options:** While originally a CLI tool, potential API endpoints and cloud hosting can extend its usage for web-based integrations.
